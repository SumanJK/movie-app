# Movie-Site

This website I created as a asssignment in Masai School while studing APIs. This movie site has searching functionality to search for movies and get movie description. On clicking on the links of movies we can get more description about the movie. There is a trending section where we can see some trending movies in real time along with reviews. If review of a movie is more than 8.5 then on hovering he can see a recomanded tag on the movie. On hovering on movie tiles we can see the description about the movie.

## End Notes
The CSS part was little tricky in this site. I took inspiration from a youtube video to make the movie details on hovering functionality.
This was created by me in just 1 day while learning APIs.
